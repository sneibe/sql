last_name		VARCHAR2(35) NOT NULL,

CONSTRAINT gender_cc CHECK (gender IN ('M', 'F', 'O')));





Note:
I included DOB because it is in bold text, meaning that it is a required value.
I however did not want to include it in the table because you had 
mentioned in class that we should not create a table that includes
the first name, last name, and DOB for security reasons.


cascade constraint- drop all of the names associated witht the table name
